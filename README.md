You can find this app on my portfolio as well:

The nature of this app is to allow you to to create, read, update, and delete "burgers" from a burgers database.  

Simply type the burger you would like to Create into the text fireld and hit the submit button to add, you can munch the burger in order to update it's "munched" column value to true, and you can Delete the "munched" burgers from the database by emptying the munched burgers list.
